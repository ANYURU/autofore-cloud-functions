## üîí Environment Variables

- APPWRITE_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT: The endpoint of the Appwrite instance.
- APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID: The project ID of the Appwrite instance.
- APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY: The API key for the Appwrite instance.
- APPWRITE_FUNCTION_CUSTOMER_TEAM_ID: The ID of the customer's team in Appwrite.
- APPWRITE_FUNCTION_DATABASE_ID: The ID of the Appwrite database.
- APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROFILES_COLLECTION_ID: The ID of the profiles collection in the database.

## üöÄ Implementation

The createUser function is implemented using Node.js and the node-appwrite library. It performs the following steps:

1. It parses the request body to extract the phone, password, and firstName.

2. It initializes the Appwrite client using the provided environment variables.

3. It performs input validation to ensure that phone, password, and firstName are provided. If any of these values are missing, it returns an error response.

4. It creates the user using the users.create method.

5. It adds the user to the customer's team using the teams.createMembership method.

6. It creates a document in the profiles collection with the user's firstName, phoneNumber, and userId.

7. It assigns appropriate permissions to the user and the admin team for the user's document.

8. If all the operations are successful, it returns a success response with the user's ID and membership ID. If there's an error, it returns an error response.

## üìù Notes
- Ensure that the required environment variables are correctly set to enable the function to connect to your Appwrite instance.

- Proper input validation and error handling have been implemented to ensure the robustness of the function.

- The function utilizes the node-appwrite library for interaction with the Appwrite API.

- This function is a part of your user registration flow and should be triggered when a new user signs up.
